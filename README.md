Software Test and Automation

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By applying best coding practices such as input handling, error handling, code review, testing, and the use of industry best practices. Testing could consist of unit testing which provides a way to automatically test code without executing the code, manual code review, and acceptance testing to verify code meets the requirements provided by the customer. Most importantly, staying updated with the latest practices is essential to creating secure and functional code.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Gathering requirements from the user in an organized and engaged manner is critical. Another important factor is to ensure that requirements are translated properly by the customer. This can be done by proper documentation and communication. Next is to understand what requirements are functional and non-functional to ensure that the critical requirements are met and everything else that will be needed to support the effort has also been identified.

How do I approach designing software?

By first understanding the bigger picture of the application by what the main and final goal will be. Next, I focus on the individual requirements of the customer.  Then the goal is to turn those requirements into design features that all work together. Create the diagrams and documentation needed. Review these with the customer to verify all requirements were understood. Then start to build testing and verify functionality along the way.
